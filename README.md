## Overview

This game is a Tower Defense game with predetermined paths that hordes of enemies will follow. Players are able to buy towers with cash they earn in-game in order to fight these hordes of enemies. There are different towers, different enemies, and ways to sell undesired towers. Each round gets progressively harder and more enjoyable for the player. The game follows a path based system where the player can eliminate trails of enemies

## Instructions

There's two buttons on the right side: the upgrade button and Buy New Towers button. In order to buy a new tower, press the Buy New Towers button and click on the area where you want the tower to be placed (each tower costs $250). In order to upgrade a tower, press the upgrade button and click on the tower you want to upgrade. There will be a menu that opens up on the right side, and you can choose your upgrade(damage, reload speed, and range) there.

Press space to start the round. When you start the round, you will be given more money. Be sure to use it! The more money you have, the faster the enemies travel along the path.
