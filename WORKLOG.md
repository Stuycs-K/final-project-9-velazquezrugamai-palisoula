5/22/23 - Israel Velazquez

worked on a part of the class templates/Worked on printing the map background. Added new classes/changed the variables based on both Mr K's suggestions and ease of convenience (Tiles/Projectiles, and changed String[][] to color[][]).

5/23/23 - Israel Velazquez

Worked on making random maps, adding tiles at random and ending them in on the right side of the screen. Added some visuals to towers/Map to make it visible in processing, I've also added our signature e button into the game.

5/24/23 - Israel Velazquez

Worked on adding a side bar with extra information about the amount of lives/money you have and what round you are in. I also added a normal tower and granted the player the ability to click on the board in order to place their tower.

5/25/23 - Israel Velazquez

Enemies can now appear on the board, and they move like they're supposed to. They don't yet die or get hit, and towers are starting to jump them *literally*, but hey it works somewhat.

5/26/23 - Israel Velazquez

Worked on a more efficient move system, tried to get the towers to be more accurate, and to get them to shoot more often
